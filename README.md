# reactredux_login

Handle authentication using react.
Create a ui as shown in the image ,make 2 pages - signup and profile. Implement react-router-dom for the same.
On clicking signup, use local storage to create the state of the user.
The state of user should contain all the properties of the user, plus should also consist of an access token - let this access token be a random 16 byte string generated by you randomly.
Once there is the state of user in the redux states, redirect the user to a page called /profile. Display userâ€™s details there
On clicking of the logout button, set all the states back to null and also get rid of the access token.
Using useEffects ensure that when a user manually tries to go to /profile, if the state of the user does not contain the accesstoken the user is redirected to the signup page
Similarly if the user state has an accesstoken and tries to go to the signup page, using useeffect ensure that the user cant do so and is redirected to the profile page.
Show success and errors using useStates as shown in the ui. all fields are mandatory and similarly on successfully signing up show the message in a green text and then redirect to profile.
